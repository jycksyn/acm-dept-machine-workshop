# **Your PC vs the lab machines**

# **Why use the lab machines?**

![bg right:40%](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Efsg_VdU4AEb3t9.png:large)

* Linux is fun and useful
* Machine Learning! Graphics!
* Make sure your code works the same when you write it and when it is graded *(especially in 303 and 304)*
* Does your PC sound like a jet engine?

# **Where are they located?**

# **Hacking into the server room** (with permission from Joe Hause)

* Get a CS Department Account from
* Open PowerShell
* `ssh <your-username>@<lab-machine>.cs.wm.edu`
* Type in your password
    * This is really annoying
    * You can't see how many letters you've typed
* You're in!

# **A better way**

* VSCode can do everything (pay your tuition, create world peace, bring meal swipes back to marketplace)
* Download it at https://code.visualstudio.com
* Download the **Remote Development Extension Pack** (or just the Remote - SSH extension)

# **Choose your target**

![bg right 90%](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qAtlUb1q1xUCZO74-CxaUSO7f1b6VPmM2PCObUMZC6T1xEuoGb1i8BDrkeVbWG2i9JmTpRrvWnRV1FlnHUQSEbxP4uplMdObbFyFEkUBWoW6yb_K0RcpASPy1Ff807BwUSDEP5WorM7tpClqlB_VVRw-=s2048)

Once you have the extension installed, you can access the remote menu from the sidebar!

Click the + button and type the connection command

# **Click the little green thing**

![bg right 80%](./green-thing.png)

* It kinda hides there
* It's at the bottom left corner
* Click it and click "Connect to host"

---

# **Connecting with the extension**

* It will ask you for your password
* It will ask you to confirm a random fingerprint, you kind of just have to say yes and trust it
* The first time it will take a while to connect

---

# **Welcome home!**

![bg left:40% 100%](https://www.wm.edu/news/images/2021/content/convocation/home-content222.jpg)

* You can now access your home directory on the department computer with a file explorer!
* You can run linux commands in the VSCode terminal (I promise it won't bite)
* You can drag & drop files from your file explorer or use the upload/download options (much easier than SFTP)

# **More:** Create a SSH Key!

You can use the `ssh-keygen` command to create a public and private key pair so you can stay logged in without a password! (Only on a trusted computer!)

# **More:** HuggingFace!

Have you ever wanted to run a large language model or another machine learning model without worrying if your data is being messed with?

**Lots of machine learning models to try:** https://huggingface.co/

Many of these models require a GPU with a lot of VRAM-- thankfully, we have those!
